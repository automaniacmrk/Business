This includes conducting market research, developing a business plan, seeking capital or other forms of funding, choosing a location and business structure, picking the right name, submitting registration paperwork, obtaining tax documents (employer and taxpayer IDs), and pulling permits and licenses. To make your banking easier, it's a smart idea to open a bank account at a financial institution.</p><h2>Start As A Side Business Or Hobby</h2><p>Can you get your business off the ground as something you do in the evenings or on the weekends (a.k.a. a side job)? This allows you to make some mistakes, test the market, and understand whether your idea has legs before you quit your nine-to-five job and lose your primary income.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://eq47oznpfsr.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Business-Management-Technology-Blog-Post.png?lossy=1&amp;quality=70&amp;ssl=1" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Business" data-cke-saved-src=" https://eq47oznpfsr.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Business-Management-Technology-Blog-Post.png?lossy=1&amp;quality=70&amp;ssl=1"></p><h2>What is the best way to come up with a business name?</h2><p>Your business name should fit the type of organization you plan to run and it should be catchy--something that people will gravitate toward and remember, not to mention associate with you as well as the products and services you plan to sell. Originality is key. And most importantly, it should be a name that isn't already in use by someone else. Go online and do a business name search to see if it's available or already registered.</p><h2>Buy an Insurance Policy</h2><p>Other types of coverage may be required depending on where you are located and your industry. However, most small businesses should purchase either general liability (GL), or an owner's policy. GL covers property damage, bodily injury, and personal injury to yourself or a third party.</p><p>Professional liability insurance is also recommended if your company provides services. It covers you if you do something wrong or neglect to do something you should have done while operating your business.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/authors/lawyer/" rel="author">Lawyer</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/what-is-the-easiest-business-to-start.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> What Is The Easiest Business To Start?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/start-building-your-business-team.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Start Building Your Business Team </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T22:08" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/what-is-business.html">What is Business</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T22:07" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/start-building-your-business-team.html">Start Building Your Business Team</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T22:06" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/what-is-the-easiest-business-to-start.html">What Is The Easiest Business To Start?</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Business</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
