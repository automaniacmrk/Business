Don't forget to populate an Instagram feed with inspirational quotes, free exercise videos, and yummy snack ideas as well -- it's a common way for fitness gurus to build their brands in our digital world.</p><p>If you choose to go this route, it's OK to start small at first, then scale up. For instance, MOURfit is a personal training business in Indianapolis that started in a shared gym, then grew to a private gym that offers group fitness, personal training, and nutrition services.</p><p>To get started, Chantelle Simone explains three steps in becoming a personal trainer certified.</p><p>To start a personal training business, you'll need a certification. We recommend that you start with the NASM CPT certification if your degree is in a different discipline. This national accreditation only requires high school diplomas or GEDs. A Bachelor of Science in Physical and Exercise Science can be obtained from Emory &amp; Henry College.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.businessnewsdaily.com/app/uploads/2022/04/04072645/consultant_Kerkez.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Business" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Get Feedback</h2><p>Let people interact with your product or service and see what their take is on it. A fresh set of eyes can help point out a problem you might have missed. These people can also become brand advocates if they are willing to share their opinions and like your product.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to utilize feedback is to focus on "The Lean Startup" approach (read more about it here), but it involves three basic pillars: prototyping, experimenting and pivoting. You can continuously improve your products by getting feedback, releasing them, and adapting as necessary before pushing the next one out.</p><p>Just realize that some of that advice, solicited or not, will be good. But, some of that advice won't. That's why you should have a plan on how to receive feedback.</p><p>Here are six steps for handling feedback:</p><ul><li>Stop! Your brain will probably be in an excited state when receiving feedback, and it might start racing to bad conclusions. Take the time to reflect on what you have just heard.</li></ul><p>You can also create a wall of love to get past negative feedback. This will help you to be inspired and can even inspire others later on when you sell your products or services. Online positive reviews and word-of mouth testimonials are great ways to make a difference.</p><p>Similar: 12 Mind Tricks that Will Make Others Like You, and Help You Get Ahead</p><h2>Freelance Developer</h2><p>Web development has many uses. It can be used to build websites for small businesses or provide technical support on specific projects. As a web developer, you'll naturally have a technical skill set. Your knowledge and experience can be distilled so that customers without your expertise understand the goals you are helping to achieve.</p><p>This will help you test your message with friends and relatives who aren't familiar enough about the work that you do. Your messaging will be effective if they can summarize your work. Visit different websites to find your first contract as a freelancer.</p><p>A freelance developer, unlike some of the other choices in this list requires training before they can launch their own business or take on any projects. But if you are a novice, it is not a problem. There are plenty of boot camps to get you up to speed with either full-stack or front-end web development. These boot camps can even be offered by accredited technical schools.</p><p>Some boot camps you might consider include:</p><p>They come in a variety of prices so make sure you do your research and find the right one for you.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-start-a-business.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Business" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Create A Business Bank Account</h2><p>After you've established a legal entity and received an Employer Identification Number, (EIN), it is time to open a business bank account. Having a business bank account is essential for keeping your personal and business finances separate which can help you gain an accurate picture of your business's cash flow and financial health.</p><p>Additionally, keeping your personal and business finances separate makes bookkeeping and tax preparation easier.</p><p>Many banks offer business checking and savings accounts. Business checking accounts typically do not have a limit on the number of transactions that can take place, and issue a debit card that can be used for making business purchases. These checking accounts don't earn interest.</p><p>Although business savings accounts earn interest over time, they have limited transactions each month. When you're just starting out, look for a business bank account that does not have a minimum balance requirement so you are not penalized for having low funds as you work to build your business.</p><p>7. Determine if your business idea works well from home.</p><p>Consider whether you can run your business from home. There are some businesses that can't be run from their home. If you want to run a dog boarding center but live in an apartment without a backyard, you might want to consider a dog walking business instead.</p><h2>Clothing Boutique Owner</h2><p>If you dream of building your own fashion empire, why not start with a local boutique? You can build buzz by selling unique clothing and engaging social media accounts. While you can open a physical store, you can easily start online -- and if that proves profitable, you can open up a local shop.</p><p>There are a few ways you can start a clothing boutique. If you have previous experience with fashion design, or are able to knit and sew patterns, then you could make your own clothes.</p><p>Alternatively, you can design certain aspects of the clothing -- such as a graphic or a logo -- then send it to be printed on-demand at a local print shop when orders come in.</p><p>Lastly, you can dropship the items from a warehouse you've partnered with. This method is less reliable because there's less quality assurance for each item, especially if you never visit the warehouses yourself. Regardless of the method you choose, starting a clothing boutique is highly doable, and you don't need to have a fashion degree (though it certainly helps).</p><p>Take some inspiration from Sleep Ova, a luxury loungewear boutique based in Los Angeles, CA.</p><p>Image Source</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/alejandrocremades/files/2019/02/shutterstock_1143253616-1200x800.jpg?format=jpg&amp;width=1200" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Business" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Add People To Your Business Manager</h2><ul><li>Employee access: We recommend you add people as employees.
