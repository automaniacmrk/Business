The concept begins with an idea and a name, and extensive market research may be required to determine how feasible it is to turn the idea into a business.</p><p>It is important to determine the legal structure of your business. Business owners might need permits or licenses to start legal operations. Corporations are considered to be juridical persons in many countries, meaning that the business can own property, take on debt, and be sued in court.</p><p>Businesses are usually run to make a profit. This is commonly known as for-profit. Some businesses, however, have the goal of supporting a cause and are called not-for profit or nonprofit. These entities may operate as charities, arts, culture, educational, and recreational enterprises, political and advocacy groups, or social services organizations.</p><p>Business activities often include the sale and purchase of goods and services. Business activity can take place anywhere, whether that's in a physical storefront, online, or on a roadside. Anybody who has business activities that generate financial income must declare this income to Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>A company often defines its business by the industry in which it operates. Examples of industries include the mattress manufacturing business, real estate, and advertising. Business is a term often used to indicate transactions regarding an underlying product or service. For example, ExxonMobil conducts its business by providing oil.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/authors/lawyer/" rel="author">Lawyer</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/start-building-your-business-team.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Start Building Your Business Team</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T22:07" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/start-building-your-business-team.html">Start Building Your Business Team</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T22:07" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/what-are-the-steps-to-start-a-business.html">What are the steps to start a business?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T22:06" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/what-is-the-easiest-business-to-start.html">What Is The Easiest Business To Start?</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Business</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/Business/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
